### With Package Control ###

Using the show command palette command (the default is `command+shift+p` on Mac, and `ctrl+shift+p` on Windows), use Package Control: Install Package. The package is listed as `Paste Laravel` in the packages list.

### Without Package Control ###

~~This package is not (yet) in wbond's package control repository, so you gotta use Terminal and git to install it.~~
